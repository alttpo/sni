# SNI - Super Nintendo Interface

![SNI Logo](https://github.com/alttpo/sni/blob/main/cmd/sni/icon/sni-logo.png?raw=true)

SNI is an interface that allows multiple concurrent applications to access
various kinds of Super Nintendo devices connected to the computer.

SNI is cross-platform and works equally well on Windows, MacOS, and Linux
computers.

SNI is designed and implemented by **jsd1982** and was started in May 2021.

# For End Users

Simply start `sni.exe` (Windows) or `./SNI` (MacOS/Linux) and leave it running.

If you are using Linux and an SD2SNES hardware USB-enabled SNES cartridge, you will need to install the udev rule in `linux/udev/rules.d` and either reboot or reload udev. You will need root to do this.

```
$ sudo cp linux/udev/rules.d/51-fxpak.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/.
$ sudo udevadm control --reload
$ sudo udevadm trigger
```

SNI is intended to be easy to use with little to no direct user interaction. It should always Just Workâ„¢.

Once started, a systray icon will appear. Clicking it will reveal this menu:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/538152/148602819-3d11d4a2-70c5-4f01-aca7-daef56af6801.png)

The top menu item is for informational purposes and shows the current version of SNI running. Clicking it will reveal the SNI logs/configuration folder, i.e. `%LOCALAPPDATA%\sni` on Windows, `~/.sni/` on MacOS/Linux.

The "Devices" sub menu will reflect the currently detected list of devices. A "Refresh" menu item is available to refresh the list and detect any new devices.

The "Applications" sub menu is driven by the `apps.yaml` configuration file as read from the SNI logs/configuration folder. See the example `apps.yaml` file distributed with SNI for documentation on how to configure custom app launchers. This file *MUST* be placed in the SNI logs/configuration folder (`%LOCALAPPDATA%\sni` or `~/.sni/`), *NOT* the current folder where `sni.exe` resides.

The "Disconnect SNES" menu item is sort of like an emergency stop button if you need to disconnect SNI from your SNES devices. This feature is intended to release the SD2SNES / FX Pak Pro device temporarily so that other non-SNI applications may make use of it. Note that this feature will not disconnect SNI applications from SNI. If SNI applications are currently connected to SNI, this will only be a temporary measure as the next application request made will automatically reestablish a connection with your SNES device.

The "Log all requests" is a checkbox menu item. Enabling it will enable detailed logging of all requests made to SNI via either the gRPC service or the usb2snes WebSockets compatibility protocol. If disabled, only error responses are recorded in the log.

The "Log all responses" is a checkbox menu item. Enabling it will enable detailed logging of all responses and exact response data sent back for all requests.

The "Show Console" is a checkbox menu item. Enabling/disabling it will show/hide the console window which displays diagnostic messages and log messages.

Currently supported SNES devices are:

* FX Pak Pro a.k.a. SD2SNES hardware USB-enabled SNES cartridge with usb2snes-compatible firmware (e.g. v1.10.3-usb)
* Lua Bridge compatible emulators e.g. Snes9x-rr, BizHawk
* RetroArch with bsnes-mercury emulator core

## Configuration

All configuration options are exposed via environment variables. At start-up,
SNI logs details about the environment variables that it reads and the defaults
it assumes if they are not set.

The following environment variables are defined:

| Name                      | Default                                                                     | Purpose                                                                                                                                                 |

## Log Files

SNI logs important activity to a log file found in your system's temporary
folder.

On Windows, this folder is `%LOCALAPPDATA%\sni`.

On MacOS, this folder is `~/.sni/`.

During start-up, in the console window, SNI will output where the current log
file is located at:
```
2022/01/07 20:33:28.378428 logging to '/Users/username/.sni/sni-2022-01-07T14-33-28-377Z.log'
```

# For Developers

SNI offers a [gRPC](https://grpc.io/) API as its primary means of communication
with application clients.

SNI also offers a compatibility `usb2snes` WebSockets server listening on port 8080.

## gRPC API Design Goals
1. The gRPC protocol implemented by SNI is entirely **stateless**.
1. Every request is always paired with a response and there is no chance of
   request-response ordering being broken.
1. Clients do not "bind" to any specific device and are instead free to make
   requests of any device connected to the system at any time.
1. All gRPC methods are "thread safe" and may be invoked concurrently with
   all other gRPC methods
1. A client's connection to the gRPC server does NOT indicate any
   device-specific connection has been established.
1. Device connections are only established between the SNI service and the
   device itself.
1. Device connections are created on-demand when clients make requests.
1. Device connections are maintained until an unrecoverable device error is
   encountered when talking with the device.
1. When a device error is encountered, the device connection is immediately
   closed and should be re-established with the next client request.
   This is done to attempt to keep the device in a consistent and usable state
   at all times and to never get "stuck" in a useless state where no requests
   can be satisfied.

If you find a scenario where any of these goals are violated, we urge you to
file an [issue report](https://github.com/alttpo/sni/issues/new).

## Generating gRPC Client Code
To get started, choose your favorite programming language and use grpc's
`protoc` tool to generate client code [using the provided sni.proto file](https://github.com/alttpo/sni/blob/main/protos/sni/sni.proto).

There is plenty of existing documentation on grpc's tooling, so we consider such
documentation out of the scope of SNI's documentation.

A great UI tool for ad-hoc testing of gRPC services is [grpcui](https://github.com/fullstorydev/grpcui).

To use `grpcui`, invoke it like this on the command line:

```grpcui -plaintext -port 8192 localhost:8191```

This will open the gRPC web UI at [localhost:8192](http://localhost:8192) and interface with SNI at localhost:8191.

SNI has grpc reflection enabled to allow using such ad-hoc testing tools as `grpcui`.

SNI also only exposes the "insecure" grpc protocol and does not make use of TLS
because of the need for low latency.

## gRPC Foreword
In this documentation we'll only refer to the gRPC services, methods, and
messages as they are defined by the [sni.proto](https://github.com/alttpo/sni/blob/main/protos/sni/sni.proto)
service definition file. It would not make much sense to discuss gRPC details
in terms of any one specific programming language's generated gRPC client API,
so we avoid doing so.

The gRPC client APIs generated by `protoc` can and do look very different
depending on the programming language and framework generated for and their
respective naming conventions and best practices.

## gRPC Services
In gRPC terms, a "service" is simply a collection of related methods. One can
think of it as somewhat analogous to a "class" in object-oriented terms.

SNI offers four primary gRPC services:
* `Devices`
* `DeviceMemory`
* `DeviceControl`
* `DeviceFilesystem`

Let's start with the [Devices](#devices) service as it serves as the main entry
point to SNI.

### Devices

The `Devices` service exposes a single method:

#### ListDevices
This method allows us to query the system and detect the currently connected
SNES devices.

Request:
```grpc
  // optional list of device kind filters
  repeated string kinds = 1;
```

As part of the request, we can filter on specific `kind`s of devices if we
want, or just leave the field empty to request all devices.

Response:
```grpc
  message Device {
    // URI that describes exactly how to connect to the device, e.g.:
    // RetroArch:  "ra://127.0.0.1:55355"
    // FX Pak Pro: "fxpakpro://./dev/cu.usbmodemDEMO000000001" (MacOS)
    //             "fxpakpro://./COM4"                         (Windows)
    //             "fxpakpro://./dev/ttyACM0"                  (Linux)
    // uri is used as the unique identifier of the device for clients to refer to
    string uri = 1;
    // friendly display name of the device
    string displayName = 2;
    // device kind, e.g. "fxpakpro", "retroarch", "lua"
    string kind = 3;
    // all device capabilities:
    repeated DeviceCapability capabilities = 4;
    // default address space for the device:
    AddressSpace defaultAddressSpace = 5;
  }

  repeated Device devices = 1;
```

The response contains a repeated list of `Device`s.

The ideal user experience would be to provide the end user with the list of
devices detected and let them select the best device to use for their gaming
session. This list should be refreshed periodically to accommodate for devices
being connected and disconnected at will.

`ListDevices` must never interfere with any other service call, so it should
always be safe to call at any point in time.

### Device URIs
A `Device` is uniquely identified by its `uri`. A Device URI always contains
enough information to uniquely identify the device it represents. Example
Device URIs are as follows:

* `ra://127.0.0.1:55355` (RetroArch instance)
* `fxpakpro://./COM4` (FX Pak Pro on Windows)
* `fxpakpro://./dev/cu.usbmodemDEMO000000001` (FX Pak Pro on MacOS)
* `luabridge://127.0.0.1:50996` (Lua Bridge client)

These URIs are NOT URLs; they have no meaning outside the SNI system. They
are arbitrarily constructed by SNI to be used as device identifiers. End users
cannot "click" on them and expect any useful action to occur. Ideally, end
users should never see a Device URI in an application's UI except perhaps in
a log file or console window.

Generally, the URI scheme (e.g. `ra`, `fxpakpro`) indicates the SNI driver used
to connect to the device. The URI host:port or the path component is then used
to uniquely identify the device, depending on its kind. If only a path is
required, then a `.` is used for the hostname to indicate a local device and
also to avoid URI parsing ambiguities.

Device URIs SHOULD NOT be hard-coded nor constructed dynamically by application
code. Most Device URIs are NOT guaranteed to be predictable due to several
external factors.

As an example, when an FX Pak Pro device is connected it may be assigned a random
COM port number on Windows systems e.g. COM3, COM4, COM8. This random assignment
is of course not predictable and would be very difficult to hard-code or assume
as a default.

Another counter example is the URIs for the Lua Bridge driver. Since SNI acts as
a server, and the lua script as a client, the URIs that SNI generates
represent the host:port of the _remote_ side of the TCP connection from SNI's
perspective as a server. These remote port numbers are randomly assigned by the
OS and are unpredictable.

For these reasons and more, it is best to avoid hard-coding Device URIs in
your application and instead always rely on the `ListDevices` method to return
the known URIs of currently connected devices.

However, there are certain cases where hand-crafting your own Device URIs may
be your only option where device detection would otherwise fail. For example,
you could have a RetroArch instance that is NOT running on the local system and
thus cannot be easily detected by `ListDevices`. For scenarios like these,
specific to the retroarch driver, the environment variable `SNI_RETROARCH_HOSTS`
is read on SNI start-up to allow for custom endpoints to be scanned for
RetroArch instances.

#### DisplayName
Each `Device` has a `displayName` field that can be presented to an end user.

#### Kind
The `Device`'s `kind` field can be used to group devices together which are
detected by the same driver. There are only a handful of distinct `kind` values
which correspond with the internal driver that the device is detected by.
These `kind` values are:

* `fxpakpro`
* `luabridge`
* `retroarch`

#### Capabilities
Each `Device` has a list of `capabilities` that it supports. This list determines
what methods can be called on the `DeviceMemory` service and the `DeviceControl`
service.

Currently defined capabilities are:
```grpc
// capabilities of a SNES device
enum DeviceCapability {
  None = 0;
  ReadMemory = 1;
  WriteMemory = 2;
  ExecuteASM = 3;
  ResetSystem = 4;
  PauseUnpauseEmulation = 5;
  PauseToggleEmulation = 6;
}
```

The `ReadMemory` capability grants usage of the `DeviceMemory` service's
`SingleRead`, `MultiRead`, and `StreamRead` methods.

The `WriteMemory` capability grants usage of the the `DeviceMemory` service's
`SingleWrite`, `MultiWrite`, and `StreamWrite` methods.

The `ResetSystem` capability grants usage of the `DeviceControl` service's
`ResetSystem` method.

The `PauseUnpauseEmulation` capability grants usage of the
`DeviceControl.PauseUnpauseEmulation` method.

The `PauseToggleEmulation` capability grants usage of the
`DeviceControl.PauseToggleEmulation` method.

There are two kinds of Pause capabilities (mainly for emulators) due to the
two kinds of commonly available yet incompatible pause control systems:
explicit pause vs. unpause, and toggling of the pause state without feedback.

### Memory Access

The memory access subsystem of SNI is designed to allow for flexibility in the
way memory addresses are specified to and translated by SNI.

For every memory access request (reads and writes), an address tuple must be
specified that represents a memory location:

* The 24-bit address value e.g. $7E0010, $F50010, $00FFB0
* The address space the address value is interpreted in e.g. FX Pak Pro, SNES
  A-bus, Raw
* The memory mapping mode of the ROM currently loaded e.g. LoROM, HiROM, ExHiROM

When a memory request is handled by SNI, the request address tuple is translated
into a device address tuple. The device address tuple is used to specify the
address to the specific device.

The request address space does not have to be the same as the device address
space. SNI knows how to translate between the available address spaces using
the values provided in the request address tuple. This feature allows
developers to select a single consistent address space to specify all memory
addresses with and let SNI translate as necessary.

The memory mapping mode is only required when translating between different
address spaces.

Let's define the concept of an **address space**. Memory addresses may be
specified in one of three address spaces:

* [FX Pak Pro address space](#fx-pak-pro-address-space)
* [SNES A-bus address space](#snes-a-bus-address-space)
* [Raw address space](#raw-address-space)

#### FX Pak Pro Address Space
The FX Pak Pro address space presents a 24-bit custom mapping where the various
kinds of SNES memory are linearly mapped to specific address ranges:

```
$00_0000..$DF_FFFF =   ROM contents, linearly mapped, read-write
$E0_0000..$EF_FFFF =  SRAM contents, linearly mapped, read-write

$F7_0000..$F7_FFFF =  VRAM contents, linearly mapped, read-only
$F8_0000..$F8_FFFF =   APU contents, linearly mapped, read-only
$F9_0000..$F9_01FF = CGRAM contents, linearly mapped, read-only

```

This mapping takes its name from the FX Pak Pro / SD2SNES cart. The cart
monitors all memory access exposed over the SNES memory bus and records the
data read from or written to each SNES memory chip into its own static RAM
chip found inside the cart. The address ranges above are the static RAM chip's
addresses used to store the memory data that was intercepted.

The FX Pak Pro SNI driver natively uses this address space and all requests
made to it are translated into this address space.

For developers familiar with the `usb2snes` WebSockets protocol, this is the
address space used by those systems.

SNI extends this address space to allow access to the FX Pak Pro cart's
`CMD` space. In simple terms, the `SNES` space is mapped starting at `$00_000000`
up to `$00_FFFFFF`, and the `CMD` space is mapped starting at `$01_000000`.
For any other SNES device, this `CMD` space is not used. This was put in place
to allow for backwards compatibility with the `usb2snes` protocol's `GetAddress`
and `PutAddress` opcodes with `"Space": "CMD"`.

#### SNES A-bus Address Space
The SNES A-bus is the primary memory bus that SNES code deals with. If you
are familiar with SNES development, this address space is probably the most
natural to you.

The exact address ranges and their interpretation depends on the memory mapping
mode of the ROM e.g. LoROM, HiROM, or ExHiROM.

#### Raw Address Space
The Raw address space serves as an escape mechanism to allow developers
complete control over the address values submitted to the underlying device.
When SNI sees a request with a raw address space, no address translation is
performed; the request address value is handed directly to the device as-is.

### DeviceMemory Service

#### [SingleRead](https://github.com/alttpo/sni/blob/main/protos/sni/sni.proto#L117) method

Reads a single memory segment with a given size from the given device.

Request:
```grpc
message SingleReadMemoryRequest {
  string uri = 1;
  ReadMemoryRequest request = 2;
}
message ReadMemoryRequest {
  uint32        requestAddress = 1;
  AddressSpace  requestAddressSpace = 2;
  MemoryMapping requestMemoryMapping = 4;

  uint32 size = 3;
}
```

The `uri` is required to identify the device to read memory from.

The `request` contains the memory details. It may seem unnecessary to split
the request into two messages but makes sense from a reuse standpoint when we
consider the `MultiReadRequest` method.

Response:
```grpc
message SingleReadMemoryResponse {
  string uri = 1;
  ReadMemoryResponse response = 2;
}
message ReadMemoryResponse {
  uint32        requestAddress = 1;
  AddressSpace  requestAddressSpace = 2;
  MemoryMapping requestMemoryMapping = 6;

  // the address sent to the device and its space
  uint32       deviceAddress = 3;
  AddressSpace deviceAddressSpace = 4;

  bytes data = 5;
}
```

The `response` contains both the request and device address tuples and the `data`
that was read. The device address tuple allows the developer to see what SNI
translated the address to in the device's address space.

#### [SingleWrite](https://github.com/alttpo/sni/blob/main/protos/sni/sni.proto#L119) method
Writes a single memory segment with the given data to the given device.

Request:
```grpc
message SingleWriteMemoryRequest {
  string uri = 1;
  WriteMemoryRequest request = 2;
}
message WriteMemoryRequest {
  uint32        requestAddress = 1;
  AddressSpace  requestAddressSpace = 2;
  MemoryMapping requestMemoryMapping = 4;

  bytes data = 3;
}
```

Similarly to `SingleRead`, the device `uri` must be specified and the `request`
to be fulfilled as well. The request address tuple specifies what memory
location to write to and the `data` is simply the data to write to that
location.

Response:
```grpc
message SingleWriteMemoryResponse {
  string uri = 1;
  WriteMemoryResponse response = 2;
}
message WriteMemoryResponse {
  uint32        requestAddress = 1;
  AddressSpace  requestAddressSpace = 2;
  MemoryMapping requestMemoryMapping = 6;

  uint32       deviceAddress = 3;
  AddressSpace deviceAddressSpace = 4;

  uint32 size = 5;
}
```

The response returns the `size` of the data written and where possible
(depending on the SNES device) waits for the write operation to complete
before returning.

#### [MultiRead](https://github.com/alttpo/sni/blob/main/protos/sni/sni.proto#L121) method
This method acts exactly the same as `SingleRead` except it allows multiple
requests to be executed together. The exact behavior depends on the SNES device
connected to. All read requests are issued to the device in the order they 
are requested. Generally, `SingleRead` is implemented in terms of `MultiRead`.

#### [MultiWrite](https://github.com/alttpo/sni/blob/main/protos/sni/sni.proto#L123) method
This method acts exactly the same as `SingleWrite` except it allows multiple
requests to be executed together. The exact behavior depends on the SNES device
connected to. All write requests are issued to the device in the order they 
are requested. Generally, `SingleWrite` is implemented in terms of `MultiWrite`.

#### [StreamRead](https://github.com/alttpo/sni/blob/main/protos/sni/sni.proto#L126) method
This method calls `MultiRead` for every request. All requests are streamed from
the client. Responses are streamed back to the client immediately after
executing the request and in the same order received.

#### [StreamWrite](https://github.com/alttpo/sni/blob/main/protos/sni/sni.proto#L128) method
This method calls `MultiWrite` for every request. All requests are streamed from
the client. Responses are streamed back to the client immediately after
executing the request and in the same order received.

### DeviceControl

#### [ResetSystem](https://github.com/alttpo/sni/blob/main/protos/sni/sni.proto#L81)
On devices that support it, this method resets the system the same way pressing
the RESET button/slider on the SNES hardware console does.

#### [PauseUnpauseEmulation](https://github.com/alttpo/sni/blob/main/protos/sni/sni.proto#L83)
On devices that support it, this method allows the application to explicitly
control the paused/running state of emulation. This is generally not supported
on real hardware.

#### [PauseToggleEmulation](https://github.com/alttpo/sni/blob/main/protos/sni/sni.proto#L85)
On devices that support it, this method allows the application to simply
toggle the paused/running state of emulation. There is no feedback whether
the command was successful nor what the resulting state of paused/running is
after the toggle. This is generally not supported on real hardware.

## Device Behavior

### FX Pak Pro

#### Reads and Writes

For the FX Pak Pro, the firmware VGET/VPUT commands are used for read and write
respectively, which allow for 8 smaller requests to be sent to the cart in a
single USB request-response cycle. Each small request can be up to 255 bytes
thus allowing for a maximum of 2040 bytes to be read by a single VGET command.
Each original client request larger than 255 bytes is broken up into several 
small 255-byte sized requests followed by the remainder if any. After this step,
the small requests are batched into groups of 8 and put into VGET/VPUT commands 
which are then sent to the device until all original client requests are 
satisfied.

When targeting the FX Pak Pro it is advisable to keep this 8 requests per USB
request-response cycle limitation in mind as it could impact the correctness
of your application logic.

The hardware cannot be stopped or suspended to service read or write requests.
This implies there is no guarantee of atomicity or consistency of data
returned from a read operation.

#### WRAM writes

SNI uses a custom feature of the pak to handle writes to the WRAM region
`$F5:0000-F6:FFFF` in the FX Pak Pro address space.

The pak cannot normally write to WRAM at arbitrary points in time due to
design limitations of the SNES itself. WRAM is located in the SNES and is
not accessible by the cartridge; only the CPU can write to WRAM.

To get around this limitation, the pak offers a feature we'll call USB EXE.

The pak maps a writable 512 byte RAM buffer into the SNES A-bus at
`$2C00-2DFF` in banks `$00-3F` and banks `$80-BF`. When this region is written
to, the USB EXE feature is enabled. When the SNES reads the NMI vector
(at `$FFEA`) to jump to, the pak overrides the vector to point to its own
code buffer mapped at `$2C00`.
The SNES then jumps to that code which should itself end in a `JMP ($FFEA)`
so that the original NMI vector is executed as well. To disable the feature,
write `$00` to `$00:2C00`.

That's great and all, but what does that have to do with WRAM writes?

In this 512 byte buffer, we can place any arbitrary code we want, including
**code that writes to WRAM**. SNI does exactly that using `MVN` instructions.

There are a few caveats:

* The USB EXE feature can only be used once per frame.
* The buffer available for custom ASM is only 512 bytes in size.
* The current SNI implementation has a fixed overhead of `0x1B` bytes of setup
  ASM code plus `0x0C` bytes of ASM code per transfer; these overheads
  shorten the amount of WRAM data available to write per frame.
* It costs time to await the USB EXE feature to be available to write to
  and to confirm that the USB EXE code was executed on the next frame.
  In practice, this whole process takes on average 36ms.

To take more control over the approach, you can use the `CMD` space mapping
in the FXPakPro address space and use the `$2C00` feature yourself. The
`CMD` space is mapped from `$01_000000` to `$01_FFFFFF` in the FXPakPro
address space.

This would mean generating your own SNES ASM code to perform your custom
WRAM write logic (or whatever else you want).

SNI has [its own internal Go package](https://github.com/alttpo/snes/blob/main/asm/emitter.go)
that is very capable of programmatically emitting SNES machine code. If your
application is written in Go, you are free to reuse this package. For other
languages, feel free to take inspiration from the package's simple design
and implement your own ASM emitter library.

To see this package in action, you can run `go test memory_test.go` in the
[snes/drivers/fxpakpro](https://github.com/alttpo/sni/blob/main/snes/drivers/fxpakpro/memory_test.go#L12)
folder after checking out the repository. This test will show the ASM generated
as text with helpful comments about the machine code emitted.

### RetroArch

The RetroArch SNI driver assumes most emulator cores expose the SNES A-bus
address space. This is true for the **bsnes-mercury** core at least. Unfortunately,
RetroArch provides no ability via network commands to detect which emulator
core is running let alone determine the address space the core uses. It is
therefore impossible for SNI to determine how best to translate addresses
for RetroArch in general.

Regardless, SNI makes a best-effort approach to translate addresses using
the provided address space and memory mapping mode fields required to be
present in the request.

If working with multiple emulator cores, it is advisable for the application
to offer the end user a manual selection of which emulator core is running
and then use the Raw address space for memory requests so that SNI does not
translate the address mistakenly.

Until the situation is resolved on RetroArch's end and we can reliably
detect the emulator core and discover its memory mapping, we cannot accept
nor act on bug reports about this particular situation as there is nothing
that can be done about it from SNI's perspective.

#### Reads and Writes

RetroArch processes its network commands during vsync just after the last game
frame is presented to the end user. This means there is a **maximum delay of
16ms** between when RetroArch receives the network command into its buffer and
when it performs the command and sends back the reply.

Since network commands are queued up while waiting for RetroArch to process them,
we can submit multiple commands into the queue and then RetroArch will process
all of them in order during vsync.

SNI takes advantage of this regular cadence and sends multiple requests during
the 16ms window. Replies are awaited for in the order commands were delivered.

This design allows multiple applications to issue reads and writes concurrently
without waiting for each other to complete. It also increases throughput for
applications that submit multiple read requests sequentially.

#### RetroArch Versions

RetroArch version 1.9.0 and earlier have different behavior from RetroArch
version 1.9.2 and later with respect to network commands. Version 1.9.1 is
broken so don't use it.

Version 1.9.0 and earlier only support the commands `READ_CORE_RAM` and
`WRITE_CORE_RAM`. These commands have many limitations and in most cases are
not enabled out of the box. They also rely on the "Cheevos" achievement
system to function as they were originally designed for implementing
achievements with.

Version 1.9.2 and later added new commands `READ_CORE_MEMORY` and
`WRITE_CORE_MEMORY` which are not dependent on the Cheevos system and are
better designed to be general purpose memory access commands.

The older `WRITE_CORE_RAM` command does not send back a reply for successful
writes. Without this reply, SNI does not know when the write completed thus
making writes appear to the application to complete much faster than they
actually do.

The newer `READ_CORE_MEMORY` and `WRITE_CORE_MEMORY` commands always send
back replies. SNI always waits for those replies before completing the requests
and returning the response to the application. These commands can also reply
back with specific text describing errors when they occur. SNI forwards those
error messages to the application.
